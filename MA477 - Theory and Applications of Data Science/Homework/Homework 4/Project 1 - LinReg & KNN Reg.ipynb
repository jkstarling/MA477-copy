    "<h2>Description of Project</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will be working with the `incurance` dataset contained in the folder. The `insurance` dataset contains information of different people, and based on this information how much the insurance compay charges them. The ultimate goal is to predict the insurance charges for new people based on the historical information collected about each person. The features that have been collected are: `age, sex, bmi, children, smoker,` and `region`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with two separate sets: `insurance_train` which you will use to train your model and `insurance_test` which you will use to generate the predictions. Once you generate the predictions, you should save the results on an excel file and submit that to me. \n",
