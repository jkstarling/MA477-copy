    "2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC\n",

    "This dataset contains a variety of useful information. Some of the main features are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>reporting date:</b> The date when the case was reported as positive with COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>summary:</b> this column contains very useful information about the individual, such as when the individual first showed symptoms, where he/she came from and where it moved to, symptoms, how it possibly got infected etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>location:</b> the location where the individual with covid was confirmed/observed\n",

Note that not all of the symptoms are listed under the <b>symptom</b> column; that is, for a particular individual he/she may have as NaN under the symptom column but the symptoms are mentioned in the summary, so you will have to extract them directly from the <b>summary</b> column first before you conduct a frequency analysis.</li>\n",
