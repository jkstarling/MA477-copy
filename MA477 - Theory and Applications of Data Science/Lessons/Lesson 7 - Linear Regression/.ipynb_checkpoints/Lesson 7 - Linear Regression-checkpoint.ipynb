    "Linear regression is a simple supervised statistical learning technique used for predicting quantitative a response target. Though linear regression is one of the simplest and oldest statistical learning techniques it is still very useful and widely used to this day for many reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a good starting point for the newer and more sophisticated machine-learning techniques, many of which may be seen as generalizations of linear regresssion, thus, having a good understanding of linear regression proves invaluable in studying these newer and more sophisticated methods. \n",
