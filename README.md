# lecture-notes
I will be publishing the JupyterNotebook lecture notes for my MA477 - Theory and Applications of Data Science course that I am teaching this semester at the U.S Military Academy, West Point.

<b>Downloading JupyterNotebooks:</b> JupyterNotebooks seem not to be properly compiled within GitHub enviroment, so as a result they do not display properly. I recommend either viewing the <b> marked down</b> file (the file with extension <b>.md</b>) or downloading the Notebooks.

To download the JupyterNotebooks follow the steps below:

<ol>
  
 <li> Click on the tab <b> Raw</b>
  <li> Right click on the page and select <i>Save As</i></li>
  <li> Change <i> Save as type:</i> to <i> All Files</i></li>
  <li> Save the file to your designated folder and manually add the extension <b>.ipynb</b>
  
</ol>
